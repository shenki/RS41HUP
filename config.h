// Refer to the payload ID list here: https://github.com/projecthorus/horusdemodlib/blob/master/payload_id_list.txt
// Payload IDs can be reqested by either raising an Issue, or a Pull Request on https://github.com/projecthorus/horusdemodlib/
// An ID of 0 ('4FSKTEST') can be used for on-ground testing, but DO NOT use this for a flight!!!

// *********** Power Saving ******************
//
// Power Consumption Notes (all @ 3V):
// - GPS Max Performance, Transmitting @ 13 dBm = ~150 mA
// - GPS Max Performance, Not Transmitting = 70-90mA
// - GPS in PowerSave Mode, Transmitting @ 13 dBm = ~120 mA
// - GPS in PowerSave Mode, not Transmitting = 30-50mA
// If enabled, transmit incrementing tones in the 'idle' period between packets.
// This will only function if ONLY MFSK is enabled.
// Note, you need to COMMENT this line out to disable this, not just set it to 0
#define CONTINUOUS_MODE 1

// Delay *between* transmitted packets (milliseconds)
// If you only have MFSK_4 enabled, and MFSK_CONTINUOUS (below) is disabled,
// Then the transmitter will turn off between transmissions. This saves about 50mA of power consumption.
// The maximum TX_DELAY is 65535*(1000/BAUD_RATE), so about 655.35 seconds for 100 baud
#define TX_DELAY  1000

// If defined, transmit a short 20ms 'pip' between transmissions every X milliseconds.
// This number needs to be smaller than TX_DELAY
// Comment out the line to disable this.
//#define TX_PIP  5000

// Number of symbols to transmit the pip for. 
// At 100 baud, each symbol is 10ms

// *********** Deep Sleep Mode ******************
// Deep Sleep Modes intended for long duration flights only!
// NOTE: This mode is a bit buggy, still some work to do.
// Current issues:
// When coming back out of sleep mode, the time isn't correct.
// Position *might* be OK, but i'm not sure yet.
//
// Only use this mode with MFSK transmissions.
//
// Power consumption in sleep mode = 32mA @ 3V
//
// In this mode, the GPS is turned into a sleep mode in between transmissions.
// During this sleep period, we sent one 'pip' every few seconds.
// At the end of the sleep period, the GPS is powered back up, and we await the GPS
// to obtain a fix before transmitting our position. While waiting for GPS lock, we
// send a 'double pip'.

// Go to sleep for X minutes between transmissions.
// In this time, the GPS will be completely powered down.
// If defined, sleep for this many minutes between transmissions.
//#define DEEP_SLEEP 2

// Send a short pip every X milliseconds to let people know the transmitter is running.
#define DEEP_SLEEP_PIPS 10000



//***********Other Settings ******************
// Switch sonde ON/OFF via Button
// If this is a flight you might prevent sonde from powered off by button
